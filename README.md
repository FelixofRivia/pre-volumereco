# Pre - volumereco for GRAIN
## Introduction
DUNE is a new generation long baseline neutrino experiment with a wide spectrum of scientific goals like the determination of neutrino mass ordering, the study of CP symmetry violation in the leptonic sector, the observation of supernova neutrinos and physics beyond the Standard Model. It will consist of a Near Detector at 547 m from the neutrino source and a Far Detector placed ~1300 km apart. One component of the Near Detector complex is the experimental apparatus called SAND. One component of SAND is the GRAIN (GRanular Argon for Interactions of Neutrinos) sub-detector, a new liquid Argon detector that aims to perform imaging of neutrino interactions using scintillation light, providing vertexing and tracking information.
